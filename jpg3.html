    <p><b>The <span class="demo">briard</span>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian</b><br> of sheep.</p>
    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bredfor centuries to herd and to<br> protect sheep. The breed 
    was used by the French Army assentries, messengers and to search for<br> wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. 
    Briards were used in the First World War almost<br> to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne,<br>
     Napolean, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
